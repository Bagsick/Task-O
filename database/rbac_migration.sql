-- Migration: Implement Project roles and permissions

-- 1. Create project_members table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.project_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'member')),
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'accepted' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)
);

-- Ensure status column exists even if table was already created
DO $$ 
BEGIN 
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='project_members' AND column_name='status') THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.project_members ADD COLUMN status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'accepted' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected'));
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Create helper functions for RLS to avoid recursion
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_project_role(p_id UUID)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT role FROM public.project_members
    WHERE project_id = p_id
    AND user_id = auth.uid()
    LIMIT 1
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 3. Migrate existing owners to admins
INSERT INTO public.project_members (project_id, user_id, role)
SELECT id, owner_id, 'admin' FROM public.projects
ON CONFLICT (project_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;

-- 4. Update Projects RLS Policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own projects or team projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update projects" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete projects" ON public.projects;

CREATE POLICY "Members can view projects"
  ON public.projects FOR SELECT
  USING (
    owner_id = auth.uid() OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.project_members
      WHERE project_id = public.projects.id
      AND user_id = auth.uid()
      AND status = 'accepted'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can update projects"
  ON public.projects FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    public.get_project_role(id) = 'admin'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete projects"
  ON public.projects FOR DELETE
  USING (
    public.get_project_role(id) = 'admin'
  );

-- 5. Update Tasks RLS Policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view tasks assigned to them or in their projects" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create tasks in their projects" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update tasks assigned to them or in their projects" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete tasks in their projects" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view tasks" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins and Managers can create tasks" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins and Managers can update any task" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can update their own tasks status" ON public.tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete tasks" ON public.tasks;

CREATE POLICY "Members can view tasks"
  ON public.tasks FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.project_members
      WHERE project_id = public.tasks.project_id
      AND user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins and Managers can create tasks"
  ON public.tasks FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    public.get_project_role(project_id) IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins and Managers can update any task"
  ON public.tasks FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    public.get_project_role(project_id) IN ('admin', 'manager')
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    public.get_project_role(project_id) IN ('admin', 'manager')
  );

CREATE POLICY "Members can update their own tasks status"
  ON public.tasks FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    assigned_to = auth.uid() AND
    public.get_project_role(project_id) = 'member'
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    assigned_to = auth.uid() AND
    public.get_project_role(project_id) = 'member'
    -- Limit updates to status only would be better here but SQL check is tricky for partial updates
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete tasks"
  ON public.tasks FOR DELETE
  USING (
    public.get_project_role(project_id) = 'admin'
  );

-- Enable Realtime for project_members
DO $$
BEGIN
  BEGIN
    ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.project_members;
  EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object THEN
  END;
END $$;
